Things to note & understand:
-Some functionality relies on the fact that students are within the students role, and not a custom role
-There is an admin capability that needs to be assigned to non-site admin that will need to be admins for the evaluations.
-smtp needs to be setup, along with cron service to have reminders sent, and other functionality
-Question types can be added, but please note the required elements that are needed (look at question_comment for the most basic setup required, and question_5_rate for a more complicated example)

-tcpdf library is used for dynamic pdfs, and may take time to create (not cache or stored)
-server SUPPORT EMAIL is contained in the emails sent by moodle
-Theres a moodle bug where when an error is returned to a form - it doesn't want to load the data into date selectors without errors...(The data is sent to set_data function but nothing happens
    -A hidden field has been added to fix the issue
    -seems to only occur in the limited version of the eval_form


If you ever choose to use Admin Reports again then you will have to rewrite large portions of them. They have not been updated along with the anonymouse reports.

I am the last of three people to work on this plugin. The first two didn't comment
at all =/. I'm now trying to comment it and make it readable however I haven't done 
a whole lot with this plugin so I barely understand it. Therefore I can't promise
my comments will be that great or even useful/correct.
