@todo

-delete needs to checked for most evaluation SQL calls using get_records and get_records_sql
    -need to implement deleted check for many pages(errors)


@TODOS
1. Reports
    -detailed dean report(What do they want added)
    -admin report???
2. invigilator type of eval

4.add invigilator email to created event


X.comparative  / admin setup?


Development Questions:
-What needs to be added to the dean report in comparison to the anonymous report?
-What needs to be included in the admin report version of the anonymous report?
-What users do you want to be an invigilator? Would this be a moodle user at the system level, or a user registered in a course. I know that these invigilator as usually grad students, that are unrelated to the course. In this case, the list of these people will be HUGE when selecting.
-What is all entailed with the comparative report, and comparative matrix. 


-Theres a moodle bug where when an error is returned to a form - it doesn't want to load the data into date selectors without errors...(The data is sent to set_data function but nothing happens
    -A hidden field has been added to fix the issue
    -seems to only occur in the limited version of the eval_form
