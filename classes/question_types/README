These questions were decently designed and could be used quite well by the 
anonym_report_PDF.php page which is the script that generates reports for report.php

However at the time of writing this report.php ignores the following useful 
functions but still performs the actions in very convoluted ways:

function average($responses);
function median($responses);
function mode($responses);
function range($responses);
function count_responses($responses_data)
function display($mform, ...);

=/ I'm guessing that the classes in this folder were designed by a person who inherited this code
but they didn't have time to rewrite functions to use them. Much in the same way that 
I don't have the time to fix anonym_report_PDF.php. Hopefully someone at some point will
have the time to fix the code.

functions that should be added
function isResponsePositive($response);
function isResponseNegative($response);

4,5 on QUESTION_5's should be positive. 3 is neutral and 2,1 are negative. However 
I had to make it so 3, 4, and 5 are all positive in order to get it working quickly 
using anonym_report_PDF's current setup.
